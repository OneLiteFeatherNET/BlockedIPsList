# BlockedIPsList
This is a simple ip list to block ip addresses that are malicious or compromised.
We will be adding more ip addresses to this list occasionally.

To use this list, simply add the ip address list (.txt file) to your firewall.
At the moment, only ipv4 is supported.

If you find any ip addresses that are not in this list, please let us know in a PR.

Also if your server is in this list, open a Pull Request with the ip address, be sure to stop the unwanted traffic from your server and promise it in the PR.

If you search for more ip addresses, check out these lists as well:
